          ASCE CET is the student chapter of the American Society of Civil
          Engineers at the College of Engineering Trivandrum. We bring together
          students passionate about civil engineering and hands-on learning.
          Through workshops, expert talks, industry visits, and technical
          events, we help members grow beyond the classroom. Our goal is to
          inspire future engineers to innovate, collaborate, and create
          sustainable solutions.
